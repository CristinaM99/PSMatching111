This repositoory contains the source code to replicate the simulation presented in the work by Marelli C. et al. "A 1:1:1 propensity score matching design to account for center-specific antimicrobial treatment or prophylaxis in observational studies: the case of the POSACOVID study" (doi:)

This repository contains the code to:
1. generate datasets and calculate performances in SAS according to the simulation parameters described in Appendix A.2
2. perform the proposed three-way matching (1:1:1 PSM) of one treated subject and two controls in R following the algorithm described in Appendix A.1
